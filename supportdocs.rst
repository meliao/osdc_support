How to Use the Support Docs
--------------------------------

These support documents serve as a template for the community to better understand available resources and how to maximize their effectiveness.   For all users we recommend a review of the guide all the way through :ref:`Command Line Tools and Floating IPs <commandline>` and then reviewing any sections committed to the resource on which you have an allocation.   

Some Frequently Asked Questions can be found in our :ref:`FAQ <faq>`.       

Adding to or Editing the Documentation
--------------------------------------

The support documents for the OSDC ecosystem rely on the input of our user community for clarity and improvement.  As you review the support documents and would like to suggest updates or additions, please submit changes to our `Github Page <https://github.com/LabAdvComp/osdc_support>`_.
