Introduction to the OSDC
===========================================

The `Open Science Data Cloud <https://opensciencedatacloud.org>`_
(OSDC) is a distributed, cloud-based infrastructure for managing,
analyzing, archiving and sharing scientific data sets.   

The OSDC operates one major public compute cloud named Sullivan and one storage cloud named Root. 
Sullivan is an `OpenStack <http://www.openstack.org/>`_ based cloud and the default cloud for
new users. Root hosts about 1 PB of `public data sets <http://www.opensciencedatacloud.org/publicdata>`_ and is accessible from all OSDC resources.

  * **Note**: OSDC resources are generally named after prominent Chicago Architects ie:  Sullivan = Louis Sullivan, Atwood = Charles Atwood, etc...

The OSDC also operates several protected clouds to provide platforms for users to compute over large protected human genomic datasets. These include the `Bionimbus Protected Data Cloud <https://bionimbus-pdc.opensciencedatacloud.org>`_ and the `Atwood (or Conte) Cloud <http://www.contechicago.org/conte-cores/core-b>`_.

Each cloud has a distributed `Gluster File System <http://www.gluster.org/>`_ where users can store their data and access it from all of their VMs.

The OSDC manages two Hadoop clusters, OCC-Y and Skidmore, for select projects. The current documentation here does not cover the Hadoop clusters. If you are interested in these please contact us at info@opencloudconsortium.org.
