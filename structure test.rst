Test of Structure
=====================

In addition to the OSDC console, there are a number of command line tools to manage virtual machines and cloud settings. The Eucalyptus tools (euca2ools) all start with 'euca-' while the OpenStack tools have a variety of names, the primary one being 'nova'. The euca2ools can be used on the OpenStack based clouds, but the OpenStack tools can not be used on Eucalyptus based clouds. On Sullivan and the protected data clouds we do recommend using the OpenStack tools because they have a number of nice features. This page will describe some of the more common tasks, more details can be found on the `Eucalyptus <http://www.eucalyptus.com/>`_ and `OpenStack <http://www.openstack.org/>`_ sites.
